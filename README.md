# Denal05_SwiftOtterOrderExport
A Magento 2 module built as an exercise for the SwiftOtter "Prep Course for Adobe Certified Professional Developer (AD0-E702)" by Joseph Maxwell

The goal of this module is to:
1. Initialize the module.
2. Add layout XML instructions, create a .phtml template, set up a view model and link a .js -ile to power up the display on the View Order page.
3. Create the admin controller which will trigger the necessary processes.
4. Build out business logic to transform the order into a PHP array, which is easily converted to JSON.
5. Post the order to a web service.
6. Update the database to provide details as to when the order was exported.
7. Return the response to the frontend.

## SwiftOtter's Associate Developer Project Guide

Welcome to the most practical resource on beginning Magento development. The end result of this is to
take (and pass) the Magento 2 Associate Developer certification. This course is developed by
[Joseph Maxwell](https://swiftotter.com/team/joseph), a 2019 Magento Master. He has written hundreds of pages of test-prep material.

This course is
comprised of several parts:
* The code ([here](https://gitlab.com/swiftotter/associate-study-guide.git)). Feel free to use this as a template or reference, but please do not use it
  as a "copy, paste and pass" toolâ€”as *that will not work*.
* The [project guide PDF](https://swiftotter.com/media/associate-project-guide.pdf). This is a detailed
  and in-depth guide that walks you through how to complete this project. It's not a "do this", but rather,
  it gives you the reasons why to do this and how to find the solution yourself.
* The [video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlFTzkGZAz4&list=PLrW94TMW-eohnHkJuKzJm2RPhbqfMbDjd).
  This walks you through everything you need to know to get the job done. Seriously, this is my
  commentary and thoughts around building out each step of the implementation. Videos are released weekly.
* The [study guide / practice test](https://swiftotter.com/technical/certifications/magento-2-certified-associate-study-guide).
  This is the final level of study for the Associate Developer certification.
